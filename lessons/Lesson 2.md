### Enter your first lines of code

Into the newly created file, enter the following lines of code:

```
import streamlit as st

st.write('Hello world!')
```

Save the file.

### Run the app

Click on the terminal tab at the bottom of the PyCharm interface. 

In the terminal, enter the following:

streamlit run st-app-01.py

A browser window should pop-up showing the newly created Streamlit app.

**Congratulations!** You have just created your first Streamlit app!
