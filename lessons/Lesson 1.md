## Install the Streamlit library

It's now time to install the `streamlit` library. 

#### Check your python install

First, let's see if python is installed correctly. Open a terminal (cmd) window on your computer and type.

```bash
python --version
```
If installed, the version of python that is installed on your computer will display.

#### Install streamlit

In the same command window type:

```bash
pip install streamlit
```

To see if streamlit is installed correctly, type

```bash
streamlit hello
```

If successful, your browser will open a window that has the header "Welcome to Streamlit!", as well as some other 
demos on the left side panel.
